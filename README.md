# PortfolioProjects

The purpose of these portfolio projects is to show case my skills in data analysis. I will be using Microsoft SQL Server Management System and SQL to perform
data cleaning and exploratory data analysis as well as Python to look deeper into the statistical analysis of data. Tableau will also be utilized to visualize 
information found in these analyses.
